### Pre-trained models

The pre-trained DeFMO model as reported in the paper is available here: https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/M06QR8jHog9GAcF. Put them into ./saved_models sub-folder.

### Inference
For generating video temporal super-resolution:
```bash
python run.py --video example/falling_pen.avi
```

For generating temporal super-resolution of a single frame with the given background:
```bash
python run.py --im example/im.png --bgr example/bgr.png
```

### Synthetic dataset generation
For the dataset generation, please download: 

* ShapeNetCore.v2 dataset: https://www.shapenet.org/.

* Textures from the DTD dataset: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/. The exact split used in DeFMO is from the "Neural Voxel Renderer: Learning an Accurate and Controllable Rendering Tool" model and can be downloaded here: https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/9Abv3QRm0ZgPzhK.

* Backgrounds for the training dataset from the VOT dataset: https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2018/dataset.html. 

* Backgrounds for the testing dataset from the Sports1M dataset: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepvideo/.

* Blender 2.79b with Python enabled.

Then, insert your paths in renderer/settings.py file. To generate the dataset, run in renderer sub-folder: 
```bash
python run_render.py
```
Note that the full training dataset with 50 object categories, 1000 objects per category, and 24 timestamps takes up to 1 TB of storage memory. Due to this and also the ShapeNet licence, we cannot make the pre-generated dataset public - please generate it by yourself using the steps above. 

### Training
Set up all paths in main_settings.py and run
```bash
python train.py
```
